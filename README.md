# CS-230-Portfolio
Portfolio for CS 230 coursework, including The Gaming Room software design document.

Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Their Software Requirements

The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based version that works across multiple platforms. The key software requirements included:

- Supporting multiple teams and players while ensuring unique names for each.

- Ensuring only one instance of the game exists in memory at a time.

- Implementing design patterns like Singleton (to manage a single instance) and Iterator (to efficiently navigate teams and players).

- Ensuring security, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility.

Strengths in Developing the Documentation

- One strength in developing this documentation was the clear organization of requirements and solutions. The design document effectively outlined business and technical needs, making it easier to implement. Additionally, the evaluation of different operating systems helped in making informed recommendations.

Benefits of the Design Document for Development

- Working through a structured design document was helpful because it clearly mapped out the system architecture, constraints, and requirements before coding. This approach reduced errors and improved efficiency since potential issues were identified early.

Area for Revision and Improvement

- If one part of the work were to be revised, it would be the security section. While it covered encryption and secure logins, additional threat modeling and attack prevention strategies could be included to strengthen the game’s security.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

- Understanding the user’s needs was key to creating a scalable and efficient design. Features like real-time communication, latency handling, and cloud storage were implemented based on user expectations. Considering user needs is crucial because a game must be smooth, responsive, and easy to access across different platforms.

Approach to Software Design

The approach to designing software involved:

1. Analyzing Requirements – Identifying business and technical constraints.

2. Using Design Patterns – Implementing Singleton and Iterator for better structure.

3. Evaluating Platforms – Comparing Linux, Windows, and Mac for the best fit.

4. Security Measures – Using encryption, authentication, and firewalls.

5. Cloud-Based Storage – Ensuring scalability with AWS or Google Cloud.

Future Strategies

- In future projects, modeling user interactions, testing scalability earlier, and enhancing security strategies would be prioritized. Additionally, using prototyping and agile development can help refine the design based on user feedback.
